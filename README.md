# SyntheticData

SyntheticData is a collection of method used to generate random number in a more systematic way.

It support:
 - random number generation given mean and standard deviation of a Normal distribution. (See rn_gen) 
 - random ADerrors.uwreal (See rn_uwreal_gen)
 - random correlated numbers generation, given mean and correlation matrix (see corr_data_gen)
 - random walk generation (see random_walk)
 - generation of autocorrelated data for Monte Carlo mock simulations. (see gen_series!, gen_series, gen_cov_series)
